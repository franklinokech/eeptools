\description{
This data comes from publicly available aggregated test scores 
of a large midwestern state. Each row represents scores for school A in grade X 
and then scores in school A and grade X+1. Additionally, some regression 
diagnostics and results from a predictive model of test scores in grade 
X+1 are included.
}
\details{
These data were fit with a statistical model by a large newspaper to 
investigate unusual gains in test scores. Fifty separate models were fit 
representing all unique combinations of grade,year, and subject
